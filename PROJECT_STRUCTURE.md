# Telugu Cooking App - Project Structure

This document provides a comprehensive overview of the project structure and the purpose of each directory and key file in the Telugu Cooking App.

## 🏗 Directory Structure

### 📂 Root Directory
- `android/`, `ios/`, `linux/`, `macos/`, `web/`, `windows/`: Platform-specific configuration files and native code for each supported environment.
- `assets/`: Static resources bundled with the application.
  - `fonts/`: Custom fonts, including those required for proper Telugu script rendering.
  - `images/`: Recipe photos, branding assets, and UI icons.
  - `lottie/`: JSON-based animations for a more dynamic and engaging user experience.
  - `models/`: Pre-trained ML models or data assets (e.g., for voice/TTS).
- `lib/`: The main Flutter source code directory.
- `test/`: Contains unit tests, widget tests, and integration tests for the application.
- `pubspec.yaml`: The project's configuration file defining dependencies, asset declarations, and versioning.
- `analysis_options.yaml`: Configures the Dart analyzer for consistent code quality and linting.

### 📂 lib/ (Core Application Logic)
The `lib` folder follows a structured architecture to separate concerns efficiently:

- **`main.dart`**: The entry point of the application. It initializes global configurations, sets up the service locator, and launches the root widget.
- **`service_locator.dart`**: Implements Dependency Injection (typically using `GetIt`) to manage singleton instances of services and repositories.

#### Subdirectories:
- **`blocs/`**: Implements state management using the BLoC (Business Logic Component) pattern.
  - `language/`: Manages localization state and language switching (English vs. Telugu).
  - `recipe/`: Handles fetching, filtering, and displaying recipe lists and details.
  - `voice/`: Manages speech interaction state for hands-free cooking.
- **`models/`**: Defines the data structures (POJOs) used throughout the app.
  - `recipe_model.dart`: Definitive schema for a recipe (ingredients, steps, metadata).
  - `recipe_step_model.dart`: Represents a single step in the cooking process.
- **`repositories/`**: Acts as a bridge between the data layer and business logic.
  - `favorites_repository.dart`: Persistence logic for user's favorite recipes.
  - `timer_learning_repository.dart`: Stores user behavior to improve timer estimations.
- **`screens/`**: Contains the primary UI layouts (Pages) of the app.
  - `home_screen.dart`: Dashboard with featured recipes and categories (Andhra, Telangana, etc.).
  - `recipe_detail_screen.dart`: Detailed overview of a selected recipe.
  - `cooking_mode_screen.dart`: The "Guided Cooking" interface with voice support and timers.
  - `favorites_screen.dart`: Access point for saved recipes.
  - `settings_screen.dart`: Configuration for voice, language, and display settings.
  - `splash_screen.dart`: Branding and initial loading state.
- **`services/`**: Low-level infrastructure and utility providers.
  - `tts_service.dart`: Handles Text-to-Speech for narrating cooking steps.
  - `speech_service.dart`: Process voice commands for hands-free navigation.
  - `adaptive_timer_service.dart`: Logic for smart, behavioral-based timers.
  - `ingredient_image_service.dart`: Manages downloading and caching of ingredient visuals.
- **`widgets/`**: Reusable custom widgets (e.g., custom buttons, cards, list items) used across various screens.
- **`l10n/`**: Localization logic.
  - `app_localizations.dart`: Centralized class for accessing translated strings in English ('en') and Telugu ('te').
